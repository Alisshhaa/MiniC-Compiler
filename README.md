# MiniC-Compiler
The MiniC Compiler is a simplified compiler designed to translate a subset of the C programming language into intermediate or machine-level code. It performs key compiler phases including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic checking, and code generation. Built using tools like Lex and Yacc (or Flex and Bison), it supports basic C constructs such as variables, expressions, control structures, and function calls. The compiler provides error reporting and symbol table management to track identifiers and types. This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of compiler design and helps in understanding how high-level code is converted to executable instructions.
